  "description": "Single-leg knee drive with band resistance, directly replicating the ollie motion and developing unilateral explosive power",
  "detailed_description": "This highly specific exercise isolates the exact movement pattern and muscle activation sequence used in ollie execution. Begin standing with a resistance band around your feet, then explosively drive one knee upward to hip height while the opposite leg provides stability and fights against the band resistance. The movement precisely replicates the knee drive component of an ollie while building the hip flexor strength and single-leg stability essential for board control. This exercise is crucial for developing the unilateral power and coordination needed for consistent trick execution, as most skateboarding tricks require asymmetrical muscle activation and precise timing between both legs. The band resistance challenges both the lifting and lowering phases while improving the rapid muscle firing patterns essential for quick trick execution. The isolated nature allows you to focus on perfecting the movement quality and power output of each leg independently, addressing any strength imbalances that could affect trick consistency. Focus on explosive upward drive followed by controlled descent to maximize both power and control development.",

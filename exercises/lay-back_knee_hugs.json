  "description": "Laying on your back with your legs extended, pull one knee toward your chest by grasping your shin.",
  "detailed_description": "This dynamic warm-up exercise targets hip flexor mobility, lower back tension release, and core turning on. Begin lying on your back with legs fully extended and arms by your sides. Slowly draw one knee toward your chest, grasping your shin with both hands (avoid putting pressure directly on the knee joint). Keep your head and shoulders slightly lifted off the ground to engage your abdominal muscles. The opposite leg should remain straight and pressed into the floor to maintain hip stability. This movement helps prepare your hips for more dynamic activities while gently awakening your core muscles. Focus on controlled breathing throughout the movement - exhale as you pull the knee in, inhale as you extend back out.",
